        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Reliable Decision Making</h3>
Many medical conditions, like sepsis, do not have a clear transition point where they suddenly acquire the disease, instead they slowly transition into the condition. But when along this transition is the system sufficiently confident to predict that the person will have a given disease? Moreover, what do we do if we are not confident in any of the conditions? Developing decision policies that incorporate clinical concerns and that knows when it does not know allows us to deploy more reliable disease detection systems in hospitals. 
    
        <h3 style="text-align: center; break-before: column">Physiological Modeling</h3>
Physiological time-series like heart rates and respiratory rates have been shown to contain information about whether a patient has a given disease. However, how precisely to represent these signals and the relationships between different signals, is still in question. Developing methods to automatically learn represenations for physiological time-series is critical for implementing disease detection systems. 
    
        <h3 style="text-align: center; break-before: column">Septic Shock Prediction</h3>
Septic is a whole-body infection that affects thousands of people annually. This condition is often fatal if it progresses to septic shock, sepsis with organ failure that does not respond to fluid resuscitation. Developing methods to predict when a patient is transitioning to septic shock can lead to earlier clinical interventions and improved patient outcomes.

<p> I am an NSF graduate research fellow, starting my second year of PhD studies in the <a href="http://cs.jhu.edu">computer science</a> department at Johns Hopkins University. In addition to the department, I am part of the <a href="http://clsp.jhu.edu">Center for Language and Speech Processing</a> and the <a href="http://icm.jhu.edu">Institute for Computational Medicine</a>. My advisors are <a href="http://suchisaria.com">Suchi Saria</a> and <a href="http://old-site.clsp.jhu.edu/people/sanjeev/">Sanjeev Khudanpur</a>. Outside of academia, I recently spent a summer interning with the Siri team at Apple and learned how to make Siri like me. </p>

<p>Prior to joining Hopkins, I studied computer science and linguistics at the University of Chicago and worked as a research assistant with Joseph Keshet and Karen Livescu at the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago. I participated in the <a href="http://www.clsp.jhu.edu/workshops/archive/ws-12/">2012 CLSP summer workshop</a> on the Domain Adaptation in the Statistical Machine Translation team. </p>

<p>Bien que mes recherches ne se concentrent plus sur le traitement automatique du langage naturel, je suis toujours passionnée par les langues. 我希望用语言识别的办法为了提高医生研究。毕竟语音和心率都是时间序列。Baina oro har, niri atzerritar hizkuntzak gustatzen zaizkit. 나에게 외국어 공부를 하는 것은 평생을 추구하는 것 이다. 외국어를 말하는 기회를 항상 노린다.
